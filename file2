Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously.

It helps track changes, revert to previous versions, and collaborate efficiently across teams.

The basic operations in Git include clone, add, commit, push, and pull.

Branching in Git allows you to create isolated environments for features, bug fixes, or experiments.

Git commit history is linear, but it can diverge with branching and merging.

Pull requests in GitHub facilitate code review before merging changes into the main codebase.

Git enables you to keep track of file modifications and restore lost data with ease.

Git repositories are hosted locally on your machine or remotely on platforms like GitHub or GitLab.

Good Git workflows include frequent commits, clear commit messages, and regular pushes to remote repositories.

CI/CD tools like Jenkins integrate with Git to automate testing, building, and deployment of code.
